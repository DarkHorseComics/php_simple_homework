The Problem
===========

The webpage dh_homework.html is unacceptably static. 
- Read data from dh_homework.csv
- Populate the table with the data from dh_homework.csv
- If the contents of dh_homework.csv get changed (different numbers, perhaps another title added) the contents of the table should reflect that change the next time the page is loaded.
- Add column-based sorting to the table using the method of your choice (e.g. click on the column title to sort by that column)
